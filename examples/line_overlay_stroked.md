By setting the `point` property of the line mark definition to an object defining a property of the overlaying point marks, we can overlay point markers on top of line. Here we create stroked points by setting their `"filled"` to `false` and their `fill` to `"white"`. 

 Notes&#58; (1) This is equivalent to adding another layer of point marks. 
 (2) While `"point"` marks are normally semi-transparent, the overlay point marker has `opacity` = 1 by default.
